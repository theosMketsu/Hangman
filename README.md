# Hangman
Hangman is a classic word-guessing game where players aim to solve a hidden word or phrase by guessing letters one at a time. 
The game begins with the word represented by a series of blank spaces, each corresponding to a letter. 
For every incorrect guess, a part of a stick figure is drawn on a gallows, typically starting with the head and progressing through the body, arms, and legs. 
The player wins by guessing the word before the figure is fully drawn. Hangman is a fun way to improve vocabulary, spelling, and critical thinking skills.
